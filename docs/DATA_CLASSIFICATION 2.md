# Data Classification & Privacy Policy (Internal)

This document defines how data is classified within the VIDA360 platform, specifically regarding access by operational staff (`team`, `admin`) via the `/ops` console.

## Classification Levels

### 1. **Public / System Data** (Low Sensitivity)
*   **Definition**: Data that is not tied to a specific user identity or is publicly available.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Application version.
    *   Public content (blogs, generic tips).
    *   Aggregated system uptime metrics.
*   **Access**: Open.

### 2. **Operational Data** (Medium Sensitivity)
*   **Definition**: Metadata required for system operation and support, without revealing personal secrets.
*   **Examples**:
    *   User ID (UUID).
    *   Account creation date.
    *   Account status (`active`, `disabled`).
    *   Subscription tier / Status.
    *   Bug report metadata (browser version, route, error code - *sanitized*).
    *   Diagnostic logs (performance timings).
*   **Access**: `team`, `admin`.
*   **Requirement**: Must be accessed via secure `/ops` endpoints logging audit trails.

### 3. **Personal User Data (PII & Sensitive Content)** (High Sensitivity)
*   **Definition**: Data generated by the user that contains personal information, habits, financial details, or private thoughts.
*   **Examples**:
    *   Email Address (Raw).
    *   Phone Number (Raw).
    *   **Specific Habits** (e.g., "Drink less alcohol").
    *   **Specific Goals** (e.g., "Save $50k for house").
    *   **Task Titles**.
    *   **Transaction Descriptions**.
    *   **Chat/WhatsApp Message Content**.
*   **Access**: **DENY** for `team`. **RESTRICTED** for `admin` (requires break-glass justification, currently NOT implemented/allowed in `/ops`).
*   **Display**: Must be masked (e.g., `n***@gmail.com`) or completely hidden in `/ops`.

## Rules for `/ops` Development

1.  **No Raw PII**: The `/ops` console MUST NOT display raw user emails, phones, or names unless strictly necessary and masked.
2.  **No User Content**: The `/ops` console MUST NOT have endpoints to fetch user's tasks, goals, or habits.
3.  **Sanitized Logs**: Backend logs and Bug Reports must be sanitized to remove accidental PII (e.g., inside error messages) before storage.
4.  **Audit**: All access to **Operational Data** via `/ops` must be logged in `ops_audit_log`.
